# Hello Docker

Welcome to the documentation for the Hello Docker project. This project is a simple example of how to use Docker to containerize a Node.js application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

Once you have Docker installed, you can clone the repository and build the Docker image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SJ-Kumar/hellodocker.git
cd hellodocker
docker build -t hellodocker .
```
